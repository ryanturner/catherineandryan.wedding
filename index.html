            <h2 class="block-title m-b-sm text-center text-uppercase">Our Story</h2>
<p class="m-x-auto"> Catherine and Ryan grew up around each other without ever really knowing each other. </p>
<p class="m-x-auto"> Catherine’s only childhood memory of Ryan is in the youth music suite at Lindenwood Christian Church. Every day as she arrived for choir rehearsal, Ryan would catch her eye from across the room and stick his tongue out at her. Catherine thought he was mean but adorable. Yet they quickly forgot all about each other, even as they spent an hour a week in the same space. </p>
<p class="m-x-auto"> On the church summer choir trip before their freshman year of highschool, several members of the choir were hanging out in one of the hotel rooms. A friend was straightening Catherine’s hair when she accidentally burned her neck with the flat iron. Ryan, who hardly knew Catherine, rushed out of the room with her to retrieve ice. Instantly, Catherine developed a crush. </p>
<p class="m-x-auto"> Ryan first noticed Catherine the following summer, on a choir trip to North Carolina. After spending an hour in the back row of the bus staring at him, Catherine had finally summoned the courage to go and sit by him. Ryan thought she was fascinating. He didn’t know anyone who danced or was particularly artsy. She was cute. She was nice. She listened to what he had to say. She was interested in him, and that made him interested in her. </p>
<p class="m-x-auto"> Over the course of the trip they became friends, and even after they went home they continued to talk. The weeks went on. They talked more and more. Ryan hid in his bathroom and Catherine hid in her closet to talk late into the night, every night. Ryan, who had never even read the series, went to the midnight book release of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince because he knew Catherine would be there. </p>
<p class="m-x-auto"> Finally, On September 3, 2007 they went on their first date: <em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em> at The Paradiso movie theater. They held hands the whole time. After Catherine got home, Ryan called her and said, “I forgot to ask you something earlier.” And then, after a pause, he blurted out, “Will you be my girlfriend?” Catherine squealed and said yes. Ryan signed off by saying, “Je t’adore.” They hung up. After sitting on it for a few minutes Catherine texted Ryan: “What did you say at the end?” He replied, “Je t’adore? I love you.” She said, “I love you too!” </p>
<p class="m-x-auto"> They dated through high school &emdash; they went to formals and proms, to each other's performances, on trips, and on too many dates to count. But then it was senior year and suddenly the prospect of college was all too real. Ryan wanted a big school with a strong science focus. Catherine wanted a small liberal arts school where she could study psychology, literature, and art. Eventually, they settled on two schools in Alabama: he at the University of Alabama and she at Birmingham-Southern College. </p>
<p class="m-x-auto"> College life was incredible. And, they were only an hour apart. They spent as many weekends together as they could, traveling by car, bus, and sometimes train to see each other. </p>
<p class="m-x-auto"> Senior year rolled around. Catherine applied to graduate school in Memphis and Ryan sought employment. Catherine was accepted to the Social Work graduate program at the University of Memphis and decided to attend. They knew where she would be for at least the next two years, but they hated the prospect of being truly long-distance. They worried. But Ryan was soon offered a job at AutoZone in downtown Memphis. </p>
<p class="m-x-auto"> During the summer of 2014, Ryan and Catherine both moved back to their hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. Ryan worked. Catherine went to school. </p>
<p class="m-x-auto"> He wanted to propose. She was ready, too. “But wait until I’m done with graduate school,” Catherine said. “I can’t deal with the stress of planning a wedding on top of school.” He held out as long as he could. On December 23, 2015 Ryan asked Catherine to marry him. She said yes. </p>
<p class="m-x-auto"> And the rest, as they say, is history. </p>
